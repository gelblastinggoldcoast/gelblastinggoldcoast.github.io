			<h1>Buying a Gel Blaster</h1>
			<h2>Important notice</h2>
			<p>In Gold Coast and all of Queensland, gel blasters are perfectly legal. Owning one requires no license, and there is no age requirement for one. However, it is <span class="important">INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT</span> to note that in <span class="important">ALL OTHER STATES AND TERRITORIES OF AUSTRALIA</span> owning a gelblaster is <span class="important">ILLEGAL</span>. Failure to recognise this law can result in <span class="important">SERIOUS PENALTIES AND IMPRISONMENT</span>.</p>

			<h2>Where to go</h2>
			<p>After ensuring that you live in Queensland, buying a gel blaster is simple. You can buy them at an online shop, the best ones being either <a class="fadelink" href="https://tacticaledge.com.au/" target="_blank" title="Tactical Edge Hobbies' official website">Tactical Edge Hobbies</a> or <a class="fadelink" href="https://www.tactoys.com.au/" target="_blank" title="TacToys' official website">TacToys</a> (my personal preference is Tactical Edge). These places sell a huge variety of gel blasters, and deliver to any Queensland doorstep.<br>As well as that, you can buy them at <a class="fadelink" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/gel+blasting/" target="_blank" title="Click to see gel blasting shops near you">any of the various shops that exist</a>.</p>

			</a>
			<h2>What's in the box</h2>
			<p>When you buy a gel blaster, you don't always just get a gun. Most novice line (ideal for beginners) blasters come with goggles and gels (ammo). As well as the actual gun itself, you can usually expect some attachments, like a laser sight/pointer or a muzzle. As well as that, pistols often come with a holster. Sometimes, you even get an extra mag, if you're lucky enough.<br>You also get a sheet of paper with all the laws regarding gel blasters printed on it.</p>

			</a>
			<h2>Hiring packages</h2>
			<p>If you are new to the sport, and aren't sure if you are really going to enjoy it (and therefore don't want to buy a blaster), then maybe a hire package is for you. Normally, fields will have a hire package designed for their field. Here is an example of a hiring package from <a class="fadelink" href="https://gelsoftaustralia.com.au/" target="_blank" title="Click to go to Gelsoft Australia's website">Gelsoft Australia</a>.<br>Included in the package:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A standard M4A4 novice line blaster - M4A4s are typical black rifles.</li>
				<li>A full face shield, designed to protect your entire face while maintaining breathability and visibility.</li>
				<li>A speedloader - a black bottle with a thin nozzle that can be filled with gels and used to refill magazines.</li>
				<li>Unlimited orange gels - medium softness, relatively painless orange gels that are designed to go in the included blaster.</li>
				<li>A mag coupler with two bonus mags - meaning you have a total of 3 magazines at your disposal. Note magazines can be easily refilled once drained.</li>
				<li>Two 7.4v batteries, so if your blaster runs flat you can just swap the battery out for the spare.
			</ul>
			<p>This package costs just $25, but can only be used at the range they are sold, and for one session only.</p>

			<h2>Gels</h2>
			<p>Buying a gel blaster and a ticket isn't quite enough. There is still one essential part of your shopping list that allows you to have the gel blasting experience. But don't worry - it is the cheapest part of all (even cheaper than the tickets!). The gels.<br>The gels come in many types, and below are the main 4 types (Click the images to go to the purchase pages).</p>
